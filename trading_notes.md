# Company Valuation

```python
intrinsic value = (annual dividend earned)/(discount rate)
# intrinsic value is the value of all future dividends

book value = (total assets) - (intangible assets) - (liabilities) 
## intangible assets include stuff like brand worth.
# essentially the value of each sector of a company (like alphabet = google + google maps + ... + waymo) 


market cap = (outstanding market shares) * (number of market shares)
# value the market is placing on the company
```

## Strategies
When investing, look for deviations between these intrinsic values, book value, and market cap

### Lowering intrinsic value, stagnant market cap
If some exogenous force causes the company's intrinsic values  dividends to go down and the market cap has not changed
reflecting this, you should **short** the stock. However, if the intrinsic value increases and market cap is low, you should **buy**

### Book value is the lowest value of the company
If the market cap is below the book value, you buy the company immediately
